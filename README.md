## Configuration
To setup amend default plugin configuration we recommend to put following snippet as part of `config/plugins.js` or `config/<env>/plugins.js` file. If the file does not exist yet, you have to create it manually. If you've got already configurations for other plugins stores by this way, use just the `comments` part within exising `plugins` item.


```js
    ...
    comments: {
        badWords: false,
        moderatorRoles: ["Authenticated"],
        entryLabel: {
            '*': ['Title', 'title', 'Name', 'name', 'Subject', 'subject'],
            'api::page.page': ['MyField'],
        },
    },
    ...
```

### Properties
- `badWords` - Enabled support for [bad words filtering](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bad-words). Can be turned off or overwritten using [options reference](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bad-words#constructor). Default value: `true`. 
- `moderatorRoles` - Optional list of names of roles. Users with those roles will be notified by email when a new abuse report is created. This feature requires a built-in [Strapi email plugin](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/plugins/email.html) configured.
- `entryLabel` - ordered list of property names per Content Type to generate related entity label. Default set as `*`.
